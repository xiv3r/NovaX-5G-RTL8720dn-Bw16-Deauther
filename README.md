## 🚀 NEW Update – 2025-06-01 + 2025-06-02

- ✅ **Split the code into header files**
- ✅ **Add Web UI Function**
- ✅ **Add Association Flood (Web UI)**
- ✅ **Add Authentication Flood (Web UI)**
- ✅ **Add SSID Cloning (Web UI)**
>⚠ Note: I tried to enable both Display functionality and WebUI functionality simultaneously using xTask functions, 
> but due to multiple overlapping issues, I had to make it so only one feature can be used at a time. 
> I'm still working on making both features usable simultaneously, so please don't be too disappointed.
> To use the Web UI feature, press the Back button from the main menu (the first menu after booting). 
> Also, the slow screen startup is due to the Web UI functionality.(you need to update to board manager version 3.1.8)

> This version doesn't support ESP32 functions (Evil Twin, Sour Apple).
> This is due to an issue with board manager version 3.1.8.
> To use the Web UI feature, press the Back button from the main menu (the first menu after booting). Also, the slow screen startup is due to the Web UI functionality.
